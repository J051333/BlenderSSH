# BlenderSSH
Program to render blend files on a remote machine through SSH and FTP.

---

Have you ever crafted a masterpiece in Blender, elated to finally render it, only to have to wait _hours_ upon _hours_ as your not-so-top-of-the-line laptop struggles to pump out those precious files?

Or spent valuable minutes looking around for a flash drive to transfer it to your PC? 

Yeah, me too! So I made a program where all you have to do is 

 - Set up SSH
 - Set up FTP
 - Enter IP and Port for both
 - Pass in your `.blend` file
 - Wait!

So if you have that PC sitting in the basement doing nothing, put it to use!
